### Technical Details

#### Storage Drivers
- **IndexedDB**: Large storage capacity (~50MB+), persistent, async
- **localStorage**: Small storage (~5-10MB), persistent, sync
- **sessionStorage**: Tab-scoped storage, sync
- **Memory**: Unlimited capacity, tab-scoped, fastest

#### Security Features
- AES-GCM encryption with 256-bit keys
- PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- Random IV generation per operation
- Secure key management and cleanup

#### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy initialization and connection pooling
- Efficient data serialization with compression
- Minimal memory footprint
- Optimized bundle size with tree shaking support

#### Type Safety
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Generic type support for all operations
- Runtime schema validation with Zod
- Comprehensive error handling with typed errors

### Breaking Changes
